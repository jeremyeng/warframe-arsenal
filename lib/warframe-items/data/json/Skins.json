His parts can be found in the Defection mission type, Grineer Fortress Spy missions, and from enemies corrupted by Void Fissures!\nWe’ve breathed life into Earth’s ambiance by adding a greater variety of unique sounds as you move between the different areas, connecting tunnels/paths, and between the day and night cycle. You can now experience the sounds of more unique wildlife in the lush forest heavy areas, while the overrun Grineer areas focus more on the clunking and chugging of their machinery. With performance gains and a clearer and more focused mix, Earth now offers a higher level of diversity, adding to the overall experience.\nGhastly in appearance and even more unpleasant in combat, Nox is the newest Grineer experiment, a member of a tactical chem-focus unit, and enemy to the Tenno. Seared by an obsession with toxin and wielding a dart weapon that deals Toxin and Impact damage, Nox leaves clouds of deadly toxin whenever he goes. Take caution, destroying Nox’s helmet will release the toxin trapped inside. This Grineer unit is also extremely unstable and will explode in repulsive fashion when killed.\nYou may encounter Nox in enemy level 15 + Grineer missions.\nGrineer Forest Factory Scene\nGrineer Forest Industry Scene \nGrineer Forest Water Pump Scene\nIf you find joy in neon colors flashing to the beat of killing Grineer, plug in that Razer Chroma and enjoy the show!

Transition animations have also been improved. \nChanged Mercury MPrime to Crossfire Exterminate (Infested vs Grineer, was Infested only)\nGrineer Scorpions grappling hook now has a lifespan of 10 seconds to prevent lingering grapples from causing performance issues.\nAdded Mobile Defense consoles to more Grineer Shipyard and Asteroid tiles to increase the chance of playing in unique tiles for Mobile Defense missions.\nGrineer Asteroid and Corpus Infested Ship tiles will now randomize with a 50/50 chance of it landing on a special Mobile Defense room or 3 individual large rooms with a console in each.\nAdded consoles to more tiles in Grineer Asteroid and Shipyards for more variety.\nMade a couple tweaks to existing console locations in Grineer Asteroid and Shipyard tiles.\nRemoved tiles containing elevators on the main path in Grineer Asteroid, Corpus Ice Planet, and outpost tiles to improve spawning\nCorpus Ship, Corpus Outpost, Corpus Gas City, Grineer Galleon, Grineer Settlement, and Grineer Shipyards. \nThe Grineer Shipyard Mobile Defense tileset is back, and optimized for better performance and with new randomized console locations!\nThe Grineer Fortress Exterminate missions have been tweaked to reduce tile repetition and length.\nThe Grineer Fortress Assault mission has been tweaked to have less filler tiles and shorter defense timers for the mission.\nChanged Grineer lockdown panel locked material color to orange. \nImproved visibility of indicator in Grineer hacking puzzles.",

You may have noticed the inconsistency in Rifted targets ability to interact with hacking panels.

Keeping this in mind players can expect future updates to contain adjustments to Limbo, enemies, and interactable elements of the environment, to help make playing Limbo a more consistent experience.  We will continue to monitor Limbo's unique interactive mechanic and its effect on gameplay, and will let you know should any other changes be necessary.

Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new.
